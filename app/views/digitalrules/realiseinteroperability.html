        <p class="govuk-body">
            When designing a new service, you must plan for current and future integrations with other Defence data and systems.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This is crucial to help ensure that Defence can work together across the department and be interoperable with its allies and partners to solve common problems. 
            The UK does not operate or fight alone; interoperability is our ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently in partnership with our allies and partners, delivering shared effects in support of our national security objectives.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You must adopt a common approach to integration within your service to help achieve interoperability. 
            This includes using open standards and sharing patterns and principles across Defence, our partners and NATO allies.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If integration is not possible, you must include the reason as part of your design documentation.
