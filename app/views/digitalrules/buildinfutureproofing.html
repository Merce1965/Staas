            This rule forms part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="/digitalrules/digitalrules">Defence Digital Rules</a>, as embodied in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/1-manual-home-launch">Defence Service Manual</a>.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Futureproofing describes a range of measures that help ensure the technology we use remains current, supported, secure and reliable. If you do not futureproof your service, the data and systems you use may be exposed to security risks.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Working with Suppliers</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Suppliers, rather than Defence, are responsible for proactively managing their assets and making sure the relevant documentation is in place.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          However, when agreeing to work with a supplier, our contracts should include clauses to:

          <li>include evergreen requirements</li>

          <li>address the status and risk mitigation for current software and end of life software</li>
          <li>ensure suppliers can share data in open formats and provide documentation</li>
          <li>enable tracking of all digital and data assets</li>
          <li>create key performance indicators (KPIs)</li>
