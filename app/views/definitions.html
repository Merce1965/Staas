        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Strategy</h2>


        <p>Strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve short, medium or long-term goals and priorities - or overall objectives. It sets out what is needed to achieve these goals and priorities and how we will achieve them. <br><br>Our strategies are
            like a pyramid structure and have several levels, for example corporate, divisional, functional and operational, with each level feeding into the other. The Defence Data Management Strategy, for example, feeds into functional and operational
            strategies.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Strategy must:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Set out to achieve short, medium and long term goals</li>
            <li>Refer to one or more higher strategies (unless a highest-level strategy)</li>
        </ul>



        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Policy</h2>

        <p>A policy is a set of general guidelines that describes how an organisation will approach a specific issue. Policies must be clearly written and describe the actions and processes to follow in specific scenarios.<br><br> There should be only one
            policy for each organisational function, for example quality, safety, environment, IT, security. <br><br> MOD policies are generally presented as Joint Service Publications.

        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Examples</h3>


        <p> MOD Policy for Quality (JSP 940)<br> MOD Standardization Management Policy (JSP 920)
            <br>Web Publishing Policy (JSP 745)</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Owner</h3>
        <p>Policy is owned by senior management</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Policy must:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Be clear</li>
            <li>Cover a specific issue or specific scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Rules</h2>

        <p>Rules are mandatory instructions and can restrict or enforce certain activity to ensure a policy outcome is achieved. <br><br> Rules should not be so excessive or unreasonable that they prevent informed decision-making or block innovation. They
            should not favour personal preference and should be informed by the wider community of practice.<br><br> Rules should only be put in place where needed and for specific reasons. For example, rather than a restriction on the number of programming
            languages, a rule should state that programmes must be written to integrate with programmes that are already in use. This eliminates the need to update the rules as new technologies are adopted.

        <p>The rules are owned by rule owners.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Rules must:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Be mandatory</li>
            <li>Be put in place where needed and for specific reasons</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Rules must not:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Be excessive or unreasonable</li>
            <li>Favour personal preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Standards</h2>

        <p>A standard is a document that provides requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently and repeatedly. This ensures that materials, products, processes and services are fit for purpose. <br><br> Standards
            are a statement of good practice, established by agreement and agreed by a recognised body with the aim of making things better, safer or more efficient.<br><br> Standards are often coupled with guidance to make it clear how they can be achieved.
            <br><br> Compliance with standards is intended to ensure consistent results.



        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Examples</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology" class="govuk-link">Open standards for government data and technology</a> are documented and publicly-available standards for software interoperability,
            data and document formats for government IT specifications. These open standards improve how government provides services and shares data. They also allow users to copy, distribute and use technology freely or at low cost.
        </p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" class="govuk-link">Service standard</a> is a government standard that provides a list of criteria to help teams in government create and run user-centred digital services. Certain
            types of government service will be assessed against the Service Standard as a condition of Cabinet Office spend controls.</p>

        <p>A <strong>defence standard</strong> is a document established by consensus in accordance with <strong>JSP 920</strong> and approved by MOD. It includes rules, guidelines or characteristics for repeated use - and aims to achieve the optimum level
            of order in a Defence context.<br><br> Other standards include industry standards, international standards and military standards.
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Owner</h3>
        <p>Defence standards are owned and produced by suitably qualified and experienced persons (SQEPs) or other experienced staff. In safety, for example, Quality, Safety and Environment Protection (QSEP) are the owners.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Standards must:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Document requirements, specifications and guidelines</li>
            <li>Be designed for repeated and consistent use</li>
            <li>Lead to consistent and coherent results</li>
        </ul>



        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Guidance</h2>

        <p>Guidance is advice, information or a set of instructions aimed at resolving a problem or difficulty. <br><br> Guidance sets out a recommended approach but is not mandatory. <br><br> When using guidance, users may prefer to achieve an outcome in
            a different way, but they must be able to demonstrate how they have met any relevant standard.
        </p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology" class="govuk-link">Open standards for government data and technology guidance</a> is provided alongside each of the standards. The guidance
            details how to use or comply with each relevant standard.

            " class="govuk-link">application programming interface (API) guidance</a> sits alongside the API technical and data standards. The guidance contains detailed instructions on how to use and set up the different elements of the interface to
